# Pre-Session Manual for Mobile App Development Session - CSAI Workshop 2023

_Sara:_ This manual is meant to help you prepare for the Mobile App development session. You'll find below an index of the contents of this file. You'll need to install Flutter and all its requirements first. Then, try running the hello world app that comes pre-built with it to make sure your environment is all set. Or at least make sure that the output to the command `flutter doctor` does not give you any errors or warnings.

Flutter's documentation is pretty awesome, so hopefully you won't run into any problems following it. 

## Setting Up Flutter
- For installing Flutter on any operating system, go to the [official Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install), choose your operating system and follow all of the instructions.

## Session Project

To prepare for the hands-on exercise before the session:

1. ðŸ’» Clone this [github repo](https://github.com/bowtiedalien/1stCSAI_Workshop_23/tree/master) to your local machine.

2. Explore the code inside the `app` folder. Can you run this Flutter project on your Android phone or an emulator and see what shows up on the screen?
